This is just a to-do list of possible projects and areas to work on.


  Rebuild combat to incorporate discrete values instead of percentages.
 
  Adjust profiles to balance stats with new combat system.
 
  Account for and track how to prevent one function that calls another function
  from overwriteing the changes any nested function(s) make.

To-do tyr
---
there should be like a 1/10 chance for something you have 3x the stats of to get the drop on you
quests
classes
floor 2
delete messages after a certain amount of time
maybe

shop only has 3 items that can be brought per "day"
items that can refresh shop buy amount

equipment with modifiers
find a way to make it craftable and modular if possible etc

Idle farm or mine or estate or anything else that generates resources and money passively
like a corporation or something similar

corpo tournaments
when 2 corporations want to duel all members get a DM to opt in or opt out of it
when they have a minimum amount of people and the timer elapses each member will duke it out against another member
they will get a notification on when the duel will take place 
and they can either fight it out in DMS aka the bot acts as intermediary for both sides
timeout if the duel partnet does not respond

companion pets
idle mechanic to hunt for you for as long as there is pet food in your inventory
each hunt can consume a variable amount of pet food aka 1 pet food could be enough for 3 hunts etc
when the pet food runs out they would need to buy or make more

pull discord id from patreon directly

PLayers table has a patron_rank
which references PatreonRanks table in which is the infomation for each pledge tier and the cooldowns and stuff
aka
id = 1, name= dungeon_merchant, displayname= Dungeon Merchant, patreon_cd_cooldown_percentage= 30

PETS ARE CARDS AND ARE TRADEABLE AND UPGRADEABLE FROM D RANK to SSS RANK


Stats - Everyone(players) and everything(mob/monster/boss) should have the same basic stats
        and those stats should behave similarly. The eception could be a simpler stat block
        for non-sapient creatures vs a more complex stat block for sapient creatures, both
        player and monster.

Strength
Endurance
Agility
Intelligence
Perception

Luck

def custom_value(n):
    if n < 10:
        return 0.15 + n*0.05 + (0.05 if n > 3 else 0) + (0.1 if n > 7 else 0)
    else:
        return int((n-10)/10) + 1 + max(0, (n-10) % 10 * 0.05)

def main():
    try:
        number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
        result = number * custom_value(number)
        print(f"Result: {result}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()




how does Agility,  Intelligence, Endurance, Strength, Perception and Luck affect the way the player's character does combat and how they interact with each other. Aka high strength but low agility could mean that the player's hits pack a lot of power, but he has a longer cooldown on them. High agility and low perception means that they are fast, but have a higher chance to trip or be unable to dodge. If their intelligence is low but their perception is high, then they would see the hidden enemy, but would be too dumb to realize they are a threat. If endurance is low, but strength is high, then they would be only able to make a limited amount of attacks before they get tired. If Strength and Endurance are high, but Agility, Perception and Intelligence are low, then they can hit hard and keep hitting, but they are slow, would often not see the target and thus miss, and would be too dumb to differentiate between allies and enemies. And so on.
