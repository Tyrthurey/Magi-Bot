This is just a to-do list of possible projects and areas to work on.

  Rebuild combat to incorporate discrete values instead of percentages.
 
  Adjust profiles to balance stats with new combat system.
 
  Seperate leveling up and xp handling into it's own functions.
    The level_up() function pulls the player's profile,
    double checks which level up they are getting,
    gives the player whatever choices for how they want to spend
    their level up points (or however you handle leveling up),
    and writes those changes back to the DB.
 
  Create an "add_xp(discord_ID, exp gained)" function.
    Within that function, you pull the player's profile,
    add the exp, check if it exceeds the next level mile stone,
    call a level_up() if appropriate, and returns the profile to the database.

  Account for and track how to prevent one function that calls another function
  from overwriteing the changes any nested function(s) make.
